## Project Overview

The UK Road Analysis Power BI project is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of road accident data in the UK. By leveraging the capabilities of Power BI, this project offers visually appealing and interactive dashboards that facilitate the exploration and understanding of road accident patterns, causes, and impacts.

## Data Source

You can find the dataset in the gituhub repository only to work upon. It includes information such as Accident_Index, Accident Date, Day_of_Week, Junction_Control, Junction_Detail, Accident_Severity, Latitude, Light_Conditions, Local_Authority_(District), Carriageway_Hazards, Longitude, Number_of_Casualties, Number_of_Vehicles, Police_Force, Road_Surface_Conditions, Road_Type, Speed_limit, Time, Urban_or_Rural_Area, Weather_Conditions, and Vehicle_Type. The dataset has been preprocessed and transformed to ensure its suitability for analysis in Power BI.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Apurv-Here/Accident_Analysis_Power_BI.git


2. Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from the official [Power BI website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/).

3. Open Power BI Desktop and navigate to "File" > "Open" > "File" to select the project file located in the cloned repository.

4. Once the project is loaded, you can explore the different dashboards and reports.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Power BI project file using Power BI Desktop.

2. Navigate through the various tabs and visuals to explore the road accident data.

3. Interact with the filters and slicers to customize the views according to your requirements.

4. Gain insights from the visualizations and analyze the road accident trends and contributing factors.

## Problem Statements

This project addresses several problem statements related to UK road analysis:

1. Problem Statement 1: Identify the most common causes of road accidents in the UK.
2. Problem Statement 2: Analyze the impact of weather conditions on road accidents.
3. Problem Statement 3: Explore the relationship between road surface conditions and accident severity.
4. Problem Statement 4: Investigate the influence of speed limits on the number of casualties.
5. Problem Statement 5: Identify the types of vehicles involved in the majority of accidents.

## Solution

The UK Road Analysis Power BI project offers solutions to the aforementioned problem statements:

1. Solution to Problem Statement 1: Utilize interactive charts and tables to identify the top causes of road accidents in the UK. Visualize the data using bar charts or pie charts to highlight the most frequent causes, such as reckless driving, speeding, or distracted driving.

2. Solution to Problem Statement 2: Use visualizations like line charts or heat maps to analyze the relationship between weather conditions and road accidents. Identify patterns, such as increased accidents during rainy or foggy weather, and provide recommendations for safer driving practices during adverse weather conditions.

3. Solution to Problem Statement 3: Analyze accident severity based on different road surface conditions using interactive visuals such as stacked column charts or scatter plots. Determine if certain road surface conditions, such as wet or icy roads, contribute to more severe accidents. Provide insights on the importance of maintaining proper road conditions for reducing accidents.

4. Solution to Problem Statement 4: Examine the relationship between speed limits and the number of casualties involved in road accidents. Create visuals like line charts or bar charts to showcase the correlation between speed limits and casualty rates. Highlight the significance of adhering to speed limits to minimize the severity of accidents.

5. Solution to Problem Statement 5: Explore the involvement of different vehicle types in road accidents through interactive visuals such as donut charts or tree maps. Identify the most commonly involved vehicle types, such as cars, motorcycles, or trucks, and analyze their impact on accident outcomes. Provide recommendations for specific vehicle safety measures based on the findings.
